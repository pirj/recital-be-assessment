# Recital Project

Hello, and thanks for your interest in joining Recital. We're excited to have others join our team,
and aim to build a truly excellent group. We've put significant thought into this assessment because
we want to ensure we hire the best team while also being respectful to you and your time.

You should have received this code in advance, and you will receive the problem to solve by email
at the time of your choosing. You'll have 4 hours to complete it. We send the code in advance so
you can familiarize yourself with it, should you choose. The assignment will not require you to do
so, but working at Recital will not require you to immediately work on code you've never looked at
before, so our assessment doesn't require that either.

If you have any questions before, during, or after the assessment, please do not hesitate to reach
out to Brendan: brendan@recital.software. Brendan commits to responding immediately within his
normal working hours: M-F 13.00-21.00 CET
([convert to local time here](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/)).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ bundle install

# Run
$ bundle exec ruby assessment.rb
# TODO: Add a shorter command to do this. Also mahybe guard?

# Check if it this meets the lint and test requirements:
$ bundle exec rubocop . && bundle exec rspec
```

## About The Tech Stack

This tech stack is a simplified excerpt from the Recital Backend project, with
Rails, Sorbet, and many other things stripped out.

Some links that may be helpful, should you want them:

- TODO

## About the Code

Most of the code is pulled from Recital itself. More info TODO

## Tasks

You will fix a bug, and then add a feature. These will be emailed to you at the start of your
scheduled time. The bugs and features are based on real tasks, though obviously are intentionally
simple to fit in a small time budget.

TODO: Add some info about what the tasks are

## Your Solution

Please compress (zip, tar) and email your solution back within 4 hours of your start time.
(Please don't spend 4 hours on this! It should only take you 1-2. At Recital, we value mental
health. Take care of yourself :) Take a break! Go for a walk! )

> If you have any problems with the compression/email approach, just upload to github/gitlab and

### Non-Requirements

We have tried our best so that you do not need to learn anything specifically for this. As much as
possible, everything you need to accomplish your tasks should already be in here. We hope that you
can simply modify existing code or copy/paste an existing block of code to accomplish anything you
need. However, that's probably impossible to do fully, so the following flexibility might be
helpful:

- You do _not_ need to implement for performance
- You do _not_ need to worry about tests. We are considering using them for a later version of this
  assessment, but for now they would be too much work.

### Requirements

1. Meets task goals outlined in the assignment text
1. Passes tests (`bundle exec rspec`)
1. Passes rubocop (`bundle exec rubocop .`)
1. Rubocop not manually disabled unless good justification is provided
1. Commited to git: one commit per bugfix, one commit for the feature
